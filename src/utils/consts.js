		text: 'Uzbekistan is located in an arid zone dominated by deserts. That of Kyzyl Kum (red sand), covers two thirds of the country and extends to Turkmenistan with Kara Kum (black sand). In its northern part, the great steppes stretch towards Kazakhstan. Uzbekistan forms a kind of boot whose top would be marked by the Aral Sea to the West-North-West and the foot wedged to the East-South-East by the Pamir massifs. In the east, the altitude is very high, between the foothills of the Tian Shan and the Pamir, but the highest peaks in the region are found in the neighboring countries of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The altitude drops very quickly to the Aralo-Caspian depression. Tashkent is at the altitude of 480 m, the Aral Sea at 40 m. To the east of the country, the Ferghana Valley is a plain, 300 km by 170, shared between three countries and enclosed between the Tian Shan and the Pamir. This is the most densely populated region of Uzbekistan. To the west, from a Tashkent – ​​Samarkand line, the desert begins. The glaciers of the mountainous massifs feed the three main rivers of the region: the Syr Darya in the North, which flows from the Ferghana Valley to the Aral Sea via Kazakhstan; the Amu Daria in the south, along the Afghan border and in Turkmenistan, and the Zérafshan, which is lost in the Bukhara region. A few mid-altitude massifs break up the monotony of the desert, the most important of which is the Nurata Mountains, south of Lake Aydar Kul. Thanks to a more temperate climate, the Ferghana Valley floods the country with apples, melons, and all kinds of colorful and tasty fruits and vegetables. Between the orchards, the cotton fields are nevertheless as numerous and productive as elsewhere',

Elsewhere, it will be embellished with garlic, chickpeas or grapes. The dish is traditionally cooked on Thursdays, as well as for all special occasions: Navrouz (New Year's Day), end of Ramadan, weddings, birthdays...

These are skewers made up of six pieces of meat and fat, or fat only. The most common are with mutton, but there are also beef or chicken. Kebabs or – roast meat – are pieces of minced meat, molded by hand around the skewer. Shachliks and kebabs are eaten with pickled onions. The meat is lightly spiced or flavored with coriander. Finally, the bazaars are full of other Uzbek, Uighur or Kazakh specialties. The most common are laghmans, long noodles that are eaten in soup or sautéed, manty, large steamed dumplings filled with meat and onion, chuchvaras, also dumplings, but which are garnished with carrots or pumpkin or bechbarmak, a specialty of Kazakh nomads, made of boiled mutton or beef and pieces of liver, served with onions, potatoes and noodles.",

		text: `Uzbekistan is a Sunni Muslim country, but which remained separated from the rest of the Muslim world by the appearance of a Shiite power in Iran, then from the world altogether by the Soviet leaden screed throughout the 20th century. Since independence, Islam has reappeared in broad daylight with traditions often frozen in the early 1920s and transmitted orally by the elders. This particular Islam mixes with even older religious and cultural traditions, reminiscent of Mazdaism, Zoroastrianism, shamanism and traditions linked to nomadic life in certain places.

        The tradition of welcome and hospitality is a constant in Central Asia, which again is more significant in the Ferghana Valley than in the more touristy cities such as Samarkand and Bukhara. And it is not uncommon for a tourist to be invited to eat and sleep with locals for several days in a row – the Muslim rule is three days – to eat, drink tea and meet family and neighbors. the host. Overall, Uzbekistan practices a very tolerant and open Islam. Only a few mosques are closed to women, and men will be kindly asked to leave at the time of the great prayer.
        
        Handicrafts, souvenirs
        
        On this terrain, Uzbekistan is spoiled for choice. In the big tourist cities, you can go inside the madrasas to find all kinds of fabrics, silk scarves, ceramics...
        
        The suzanis, these wall hangings with traditional motifs. The old ones, which are recognizable by the less bright colors, are handmade unlike most of the new ones, with less attractive patterns. Each city has different patterns. In Bukhara, aim for carpets instead: dark or colorful, with Afghan, Turkmen or Bukhariot motifs.
        
        There are also yurtas, these long camel wool ribbons, covered with traditional Kazakh patterns and which were used to decorate the interior of yurts by crisscrossing each other in all directions. In all the bazaars, the tioupés, small traditional black caps adorned with the motifs of the region to which they belong, are spread out in quantity.
        
        Silk is found throughout the country, but is woven in the Ferghana Valley, in Margilan. Most frequently, it is found on bazaars by the meter, decorated with the bright colors of traditional ikats.
        
        The ceramics come from Gijduvan, a few tens of kilometers from Bukhara, or from Richtan, in the Ferghana Valley.
        
        National symbols
        
        The national symbol of Uzbekistan is the humo, a divine bird that has its origins in Iranian legends.
        
        Amir Timur (known as Tamerlane) is obviously the legendary figure of Uzbekistan. Statues, streets, squares, museums bear his name throughout the country and have replaced the essential Karl Marx or Lenin avenues of the Soviet era.
        
        national flag
        
        The Uzbek flag is made up of three horizontal bands: blue, white and green, separated by two red borders. In the left corner, on the blue band, are a crescent moon and twelve stars for the twelve months of the year of independence. The blue recalls the color of the banner of Tamerlane. The white symbolizes purity and peace, and the green stripe is the color of Islam.
        
        National anthem
        
        The Uzbek national anthem was written just after independence by Abdulla Oripov to music composed by Mutal Burkhonov. It praises the merits of the country and its inhabitants, proud to have been born there and to live there in peace...`,
